  <h1>STEP 1 of understanding a DC motor</h1>
  <p>This model shows the magnetic field between the magnets and the current flowing through the wire when a battery is connected. It also shows the magnetic relationship between the wire and the magnets. The electric current is supplied by the battery. The current flows from positive to negative. <p>

  <h2>STEP 2 of understanding a DC motor</h2>
  <p>This model shows the current flowing through the wire when a battery is connected. It also shows how the current of the wire switches when the commutator rotates each half rotation. <p>

  <h3>STEP 3 of understanding a DC motor</h3>
  <p>This model shows the exploded view of a DC motor. It shows how the electric current that flows through the coil produces a torque that turns the DC motor which is caused by the magnetic force. It shows the rotational force of the rotating armature, brush, and shaft.<p>
